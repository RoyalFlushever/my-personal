Development Approach: (Excerpt from 37signals.com) To be accurate, it is my growing yet development approach
 1. Find the Vision of the app. it not only technology but also DEVELOPMENT ME. - CAREER
    This product or web app is intended for some my own purposes, ordering by prority.
    1) Self-confident with software development
    2) Build your own TRIAL development approach even under pressure and heavy other job workloads - that means daily contribution
    3) Knowledge with Git 
    4) Knowledge with Bootstrap 4, Node, React
 2. Start quickly (but most hard part to find your appropriate starter kit)
 3. From Big to small
  Just Layout things(Basic functionality and Wireframes)
  : Using Bootstrap or HTML Template
  : basic functionality working (here is instagram API)
 4. slice your job into small pieces so that you can enjoy every results and congrtulates your commitment.(self-discipline oriented)
    NO Spread out your work timeline and scope. (just one by one) - it is like a unit test idea. 

Further Development:
 Refactoring Frontend part using React.JS
 *Git use
    Branch use for further Team work
    
    create a branch for react development.
